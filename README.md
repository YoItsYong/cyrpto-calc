# Crypto Calculator
This is the first project I made after getting a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javscript. Towards the beginning of COVID shutdowns, there was a lot of talk and hype around investing in cryptocurrencies. During this time, I didn't have a large budget to invest with so I was watching prices and considering whether it was the right time to jump in.

I regularly would think, "Well what if I bought for that price and sold for this price in X months?". However, the process of doing the math myself took long enought that I would either lose interest or something more important would come up. In each of these instances, I would always think about how nice it would be to have an app that could do the math for me.

While the hype around crypto (along with my interest) has evaporated, I am still proud that I was able to create something solely from that "what if" inkling and managed to do the research to bring it into existence.

The main functions of this application are to:
<li>Get live Cyrpto prices</li>
<li>Calculate profit if coins were sold at certain prices</li>
